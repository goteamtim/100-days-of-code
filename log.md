# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started my repo for the 100 day challenge

**Thoughts:** Really excited to build a progress tracker for the challenge.

### Day 1: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got the api calls working with github and was able to display information about a repo using their API.

**Thoughts** Working with angular saves me so much time now that I am getting the hang of it.  I want to incorporate a database in the future.

**Link(s) to work**
I have not sync'd the repo with github yet, I can do that tomorrow.
