# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started my repo for the 100 day challenge

**Thoughts:** Really excited to build a progress tracker for the challenge.

### Day 1: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got the api calls working with github and was able to display information about a repo using their API.

**Thoughts** Working with angular saves me so much time now that I am getting the hang of it.  I want to incorporate a database in the future.

I have not sync'd the repo with github yet, I can do that tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I had the wrong date for the last pushed date in the repo.  I fixed that and started working on the logic for the active day counter.

**Thoughts** It is much easier to break things down into little bits and have those little victories each day.

### Day 3: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Got the logic sorted out with the current code day.  Actually got the app working today!  It takes in a username and repo name and then tells you if you have coded today.  If you have it offers you the chance to tweet your progress!

**Thoughts** I learned about ngSanitize today wich was very helpful.  I will start to work on css soon to make it look cleaner.  I also thought about some new ideas to add to the project.

### Day 4: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Wasnt able to put a ton of work in today but added localstorage so I can keep track of their information.

**Thoughts** Forgot then remembered how to check if an item exists in an arrayand add it if its not there.

### Day 5: January 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Added a service worker and updated the UI.  I need to do more work to the service worker so that I can send push messages to the users when they need to update the repo for the day.

**Thoughts** I did not know really what a service worker did so it was great learning and starting to impliment one.

### Day 6: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added the first custom logos for the cards to change depending on the language you wrote your code in.

**Thoughts** It would be cool to automatically start tracking after the first time you log your repo.  Would also be cool to track what people are coding to see what languages are most popular during the 100daysofcode challenge.

### Day 7: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about making a mobile site an actual webapp today!  I had no idea how that was done.  (Here)[https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/] is a great example.

**Thoughts** Being able to install web apps with service workers finally makes sense.  I am really looking forward to learning more about this.

### Day 8: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Mainly some more style fixes today.  I fixed the display issue when you try and click submit twice.

**Thoughts** I keep going back and forth on style.  I need to pick something and stick with it.
