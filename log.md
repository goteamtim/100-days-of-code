# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started my repo for the 100 day challenge

**Thoughts:** Really excited to build a progress tracker for the challenge.

### Day 1: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got the api calls working with github and was able to display information about a repo using their API.

**Thoughts** Working with angular saves me so much time now that I am getting the hang of it.  I want to incorporate a database in the future.

I have not sync'd the repo with github yet, I can do that tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I had the wrong date for the last pushed date in the repo.  I fixed that and started working on the logic for the active day counter.

**Thoughts** It is much easier to break things down into little bits and have those little victories each day.

### Day 3: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Got the logic sorted out with the current code day.  Actually got the app working today!  It takes in a username and repo name and then tells you if you have coded today.  If you have it offers you the chance to tweet your progress!

**Thoughts** I learned about ngSanitize today wich was very helpful.  I will start to work on css soon to make it look cleaner.  I also thought about some new ideas to add to the project.
