# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started my repo for the 100 day challenge

**Thoughts:** Really excited to build a progress tracker for the challenge.

### Day 1: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got the api calls working with github and was able to display information about a repo using their API.

**Thoughts** Working with angular saves me so much time now that I am getting the hang of it.  I want to incorporate a database in the future.

I have not sync'd the repo with github yet, I can do that tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I had the wrong date for the last pushed date in the repo.  I fixed that and started working on the logic for the active day counter.

**Thoughts** It is much easier to break things down into little bits and have those little victories each day.

### Day 3: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Got the logic sorted out with the current code day.  Actually got the app working today!  It takes in a username and repo name and then tells you if you have coded today.  If you have it offers you the chance to tweet your progress!

**Thoughts** I learned about ngSanitize today wich was very helpful.  I will start to work on css soon to make it look cleaner.  I also thought about some new ideas to add to the project.

### Day 4: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Wasnt able to put a ton of work in today but added localstorage so I can keep track of their information.

**Thoughts** Forgot then remembered how to check if an item exists in an arrayand add it if its not there.

### Day 5: January 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Added a service worker and updated the UI.  I need to do more work to the service worker so that I can send push messages to the users when they need to update the repo for the day.

**Thoughts** I did not know really what a service worker did so it was great learning and starting to impliment one.

### Day 6: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added the first custom logos for the cards to change depending on the language you wrote your code in.

**Thoughts** It would be cool to automatically start tracking after the first time you log your repo.  Would also be cool to track what people are coding to see what languages are most popular during the 100daysofcode challenge.

### Day 7: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about making a mobile site an actual webapp today!  I had no idea how that was done.  (Here)[https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/] is a great example.

**Thoughts** Being able to install web apps with service workers finally makes sense.  I am really looking forward to learning more about this.

### Day 8: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Mainly some more style fixes today.  I fixed the display issue when you try and click submit twice.

**Thoughts** I keep going back and forth on style.  I need to pick something and stick with it.

### Day 9: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get a lot done, spent a lot of time working on layout changes that are not working yet.

**Thoughts**  Need to find a style that I like and really learn more about css so I know how to better manipulate it to my needs.

### Day 10: January 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Mainly fixed the styling and worked on css.  There is a ton to learn there.  

**Thoughts**  I need to focus on css more to be able to quickly manipulate what I need.

### Day 11: January 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the tracker today to start my portfolio project for freecodecamp.  Excited to finally finish this up, I want to finish my front end certification during the #100daysofcode.

**Thoughts**  Just a lot of setup today, after I finish this I might make a template for simple projects with the basics already setup.  This would save a lot of time.

### Day 12: January 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started working more on my portfolio but stopping now to do more research about ngRoute.  I want to use route parameters to load dynamic content and having a lot of trouble currently.

**Thoughts**  I feel like I am seeing more and more about how patterns are so useful in programming.  Once you have patterns down you can really focus more on what you want the code to do rather than how to impliment.

### Day 13: January 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I got my app working after making a dumb mistake then I got my overlay started for when a user first comes to the site.

**Thoughts**  1.  Read the manual.  2. Start with the basics.  I couldnt get the app to load because...I forgot to include my script on the page...  Now that I have that working I can get back to my code.

### Day 14: January 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I had made a dumb mistake which i fixed.  

**Thoughts**  Once again, going back and thinking about the basics helped me fix my issues.

### Day 15: January 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Linked up the initial form with the first part of the dynamic tribute page.  The users image, name, and bio now loads after they input their github username.  I also used a factory for the first time that will hopefully let me use data between controllers.  I want a controller for each of the sections of the page.

**Thoughts**  I really like working on this project.  It's giving me more ideas about my tracker app.  I am finding that when I have an issue if I just take a minute to look at my code before quickly jumping to stack overflow or googling I can usually find something thats wrong and fix it myself.
